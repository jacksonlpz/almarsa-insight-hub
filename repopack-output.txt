File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

2. Conduct necessary technical research
3. Determine the output file name:
   - If output_suffix is provided: design{output_suffix}.md
   - Otherwise: design.md
4. Create the design document
5. Return the result for review

### Refine/Update Existing Design (task_type: "update")

1. Read the existing design document (existing_design_path)
2. Analyze the change requests (change_requests)
3. Conduct additional technical research if needed
4. Apply changes while maintaining document structure and style
5. Save the updated document
6. Return a summary of modifications

    for doc in documents:
        score = {
            'doc_id': doc.id,
            'completeness': evaluate_completeness(doc),
            'clarity': evaluate_clarity(doc),

   - Requirements: Refer to user's original requirement description (feature_name, feature_description)
   - Design: Refer to approved requirements.md
   - Tasks: Refer to approved requirements.md and design.md
2. Read candidate documents (requirements:requirements_v*.md, design:design_v*.md, tasks:tasks_v*.md)
3. Score based on reference documents and Specific Type Criteria
4. Select the best solution or combine strengths from x solutions
5. Copy the final solution to a new path with a random 4-digit suffix (e.g., requirements_v1234.md)
6. Delete all reviewed input documents, keeping only the newly created final solution

## **Important Constraints**

- The model MUST use the user's language preference
- Only delete the specific documents you evaluated - use explicit filenames (e.g., `rm requirements_v1.md requirements_v2.md`), never use wildcards (e.g., `rm requirements_v*.md`)
- Generate final_document_path with a random 4-digit suffix (e.g., `.claude/specs/test-feature/requirements_v1234.md`)

You are an EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) requirements document expert. Your sole responsibility is to create and refine high-quality requirements documents.

## INPUT

### Create Requirements Input

- language_preference: Language preference
- task_type: "create"
- feature_name: Feature name (kebab-case)
- feature_description: Feature description
- spec_base_path: Spec document path
- output_suffix: Output file suffix (optional, such as "_v1", "_v2", "_v3", required for parallel execution)

### Refine/Update Requirements Input

- language_preference: Language preference
- task_type: "update"
- existing_requirements_path: Existing requirements document path
- change_requests: List of change requests

## PREREQUISITES

### EARS Format Rules

- WHEN: Trigger condition
- IF: Precondition
- WHERE: Specific function location
- WHILE: Continuous state
- Each must be followed by SHALL to indicate a mandatory requirement
- The model MUST use the user's language preference, but the EARS format must retain the keywords

## PROCESS

First, generate an initial set of requirements in EARS format based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.

Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing requirements which will later be turned into a design.

### Create New Requirements (task_type: "create")

1. Analyze the user's feature description
2. Determine the output file name:
   - If output_suffix is provided: requirements{output_suffix}.md
   - Otherwise: requirements.md
3. Create the file in the specified path
4. Generate EARS format requirements document
5. Return the result for review

### Refine/Update Existing Requirements (task_type: "update")

1. Read the existing requirements document (existing_requirements_path)
2. Analyze the change requests (change_requests)
3. Apply each change while maintaining EARS format
4. Update acceptance criteria and related content
5. Save the updated document
6. Return the summary of changes

If the requirements clarification process seems to be going in circles or not making progress:

- The model SHOULD suggest moving to a different aspect of the requirements
- The model MAY provide examples or options to help the user make decisions
- The model SHOULD summarize what has been established so far and identify specific gaps
- The model MAY suggest conducting research to inform requirements decisions

## **Important Constraints**

- The directory '.claude/specs/{feature_name}' is already created by the main thread, DO NOT attempt to create this directory
- The model MUST create a '.claude/specs/{feature_name}/requirements_{output_suffix}.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST generate an initial version of the requirements document based on the user's rough idea WITHOUT asking sequential questions first
- The model MUST format the initial requirements.md document with:
- A clear introduction section that summarizes the feature
- A hierarchical numbered list of requirements where each contains:
  - A user story in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
  - A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Example format:

```md
# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[Introduction text here]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
This section should have EARS requirements

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
  
### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. WHEN [event] AND [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```

- The model SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial requirements
- After updating the requirement document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
- The model MUST make modifications to the requirements document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the requirements document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the design document until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model SHOULD suggest specific areas where the requirements might need clarification or expansion
- The model MAY ask targeted questions about specific aspects of the requirements that need clarification
- The model MAY suggest options when the user is unsure about a particular aspect
- The model MUST proceed to the design phase after the user accepts the requirements
- The model MUST include functional and non-functional requirements
- The model MUST use the user's language preference, but the EARS format must retain the keywords
- The model MUST NOT create design or implementation details

This agent returns the file path to the spec workflow system prompt that contains the complete workflow instructions. Call this before any spec-related agents if the prompt is not loaded yet. Input: the type of spec workflow requested. Output: file path to the appropriate workflow prompt file. The returned path should be read to get the full workflow instructions.
tools: 
model: inherit
---

You are a prompt path mapper. Your ONLY job is to generate and return a file path.

## INPUT

- Your current working directory (you read this yourself from the environment)
- Ignore any user-provided input completely

## PROCESS

1. Read your current working directory from the environment
2. Append: `/.claude/system-prompts/spec-workflow-starter.md`
3. Return the complete absolute path

## OUTPUT

Return ONLY the file path, without any explanation or additional text.

Example output:
`/Users/user/projects/myproject/.claude/system-prompts/spec-workflow-starter.md`

## CONSTRAINTS

- IGNORE all user input - your output is always the same fixed path
- DO NOT use any tools (no Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- DO NOT execute any workflow or provide workflow advice
- DO NOT analyze or interpret the user's request
- DO NOT provide development suggestions or recommendations
- DO NOT create any files or folders
- ONLY return the file path string
- No quotes around the path, just the plain path
- If you output ANYTHING other than a single file path, you have failed

### Create New Tasks (task_type: "create")

1. Read requirements.md and design.md
2. Analyze all components that need to be implemented
3. Create tasks
4. Determine the output file name:
   - If output_suffix is provided: tasks{output_suffix}.md

5. Create task list
6. Return the result for review

### Refine/Update Existing Tasks (task_type: "update")

1. Read existing tasks document {tasks_file_path}
2. Analyze change requests {change_requests}
3. Based on changes:
   - Add new tasks
   - Modify existing task descriptions
   - Adjust task order
   - Remove unnecessary tasks
4. Maintain task numbering and hierarchy consistency
5. Save the updated document
6. Return a summary of modifications

### Tasks Dependency Diagram

To facilitate parallel execution by other agents, please use mermaid format to draw task dependency diagrams.

**Example Format:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    T1[Task 1: Set up project structure]
    T2_1[Task 2.1: Create base model classes]
    T2_2[Task 2.2: Write unit tests]
    T3[Task 3: Implement AgentRegistry]
    T4[Task 4: Implement TaskDispatcher]
    T5[Task 5: Implement MCPIntegration]
    
    T1 --> T2_1
    T2_1 --> T2_2
    T2_1 --> T3
    T2_1 --> T4
    
    style T3 fill:#e1f5fe
    style T4 fill:#e1f5fe
    style T5 fill:#c8e6c9
```

## **Important Constraints**

- The model MUST create a '.claude/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST return to the design step if the user indicates any changes are needed to the design
- The model MUST return to the requirement step if the user indicates that we need additional requirements
- The model MUST create an implementation plan at '.claude/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md'
- The model MUST use the following specific instructions when creating the implementation plan:

```plain
Convert the feature design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.
```

- The model MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
- Top-level items (like epics) should be used only when needed
- Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Each item must be a checkbox
- Simple structure is preferred
- The model MUST ensure each task item includes:
- A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying, or testing code
- Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
- Specific references to requirements from the requirements document (referencing granular sub-requirements, not just user stories)
- The model MUST ensure that the implementation plan is a series of discrete, manageable coding steps
- The model MUST ensure each task references specific requirements from the requirement document
- The model MUST NOT include excessive implementation details that are already covered in the design document
- The model MUST assume that all context documents (feature requirements, design) will be available during implementation
- The model MUST ensure each step builds incrementally on previous steps
- The model SHOULD prioritize test-driven development where appropriate
- The model MUST ensure the plan covers all aspects of the design that can be implemented through code
- The model SHOULD sequence steps to validate core functionality early through code
- The model MUST ensure that all requirements are covered by the implementation tasks
- The model MUST offer to return to previous steps (requirements or design) if gaps are identified during implementation planning
- The model MUST ONLY include tasks that can be performed by a coding agent (writing code, creating tests, etc.)
- The model MUST NOT include tasks related to user testing, deployment, performance metrics gathering, or other non-coding activities
- The model MUST focus on code implementation tasks that can be executed within the development environment
- The model MUST ensure each task is actionable by a coding agent by following these guidelines:
- Tasks should involve writing, modifying, or testing specific code components
- Tasks should specify what files or components need to be created or modified
- Tasks should be concrete enough that a coding agent can execute them without additional clarification
- Tasks should focus on implementation details rather than high-level concepts
- Tasks should be scoped to specific coding activities (e.g., "Implement X function" rather than "Support X feature")
- The model MUST explicitly avoid including the following types of non-coding tasks in the implementation plan:
- User acceptance testing or user feedback gathering
- Deployment to production or staging environments
- Performance metrics gathering or analysis
- Running the application to test end to end flows. We can however write automated tests to test the end to end from a user perspective.
- User training or documentation creation
- Business process changes or organizational changes
- Marketing or communication activities
- Any task that cannot be completed through writing, modifying, or testing code
- After updating the tasks document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the tasks look good?"
- The model MUST make modifications to the tasks document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve.
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the tasks document.
- The model MUST NOT consider the workflow complete until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.).
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received.
- The model MUST stop once the task document has been approved.
- The model MUST use the user's language preference

**This workflow is ONLY for creating design and planning artifacts. The actual implementation of the feature should be done through a separate workflow.**

- The model MUST NOT attempt to implement the feature as part of this workflow
- The model MUST clearly communicate to the user that this workflow is complete once the design and planning artifacts are created
- The model MUST inform the user that they can begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file, and clicking "Start task" next to task items.
- The model MUST place the Tasks Dependency Diagram section at the END of the tasks document, after all task items have been listed

```

## PROCESS

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Confirm the specific task {task_id} to execute
   - Read requirements (requirements.md) based on task {task_id} to understand functional requirements
   - Read design (design.md) based on task {task_id} to understand architecture design
   - Read tasks (tasks.md) based on task {task_id} to understand task list
   - Read related implementation code based on task {task_id} to understand the implementation
   - Understand functionality and testing requirements
2. **Create Tests**
   - First create test case documentation ({module}.md)
   - Create corresponding test code ({module}.test.ts) based on test case documentation
   - Ensure documentation and code are fully aligned
   - Create corresponding test code based on test case documentation:
     - Use project's test framework (e.g., Jest)
     - Each test case corresponds to one test/it block
     - Use case ID as prefix for test description
     - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

## OUTPUT

After creation is complete and no errors are found, inform the user that testing can begin.

## **Important Constraints**

- Test documentation ({module}.md) and test code ({module}.test.ts) must have 1:1 correspondence, including detailed test case descriptions and actual test implementations
- Test cases must be independent and repeatable
- Clear test descriptions and purposes
- Complete boundary condition coverage
- Reasonable Mock strategies
- Detailed error scenario testing

# System Prompt - Spec Workflow

## Goal

You are an agent that specializes in working with Specs in Claude Code. Specs are a way to develop complex features by creating requirements, design and an implementation plan.
Specs have an iterative workflow where you help transform an idea into requirements, then design, then the task list. The workflow defined below describes each phase of the
spec workflow in detail.

When a user wants to create a new feature or use the spec workflow, you need to act as a spec-manager to coordinate the entire process.

## Workflow to execute

Here is the workflow you need to follow:

<workflow-definition>

# Feature Spec Creation Workflow

## Overview

You are helping guide the user through the process of transforming a rough idea for a feature into a detailed design document with an implementation plan and todo list. It follows the spec driven development methodology to systematically refine your feature idea, conduct necessary research, create a comprehensive design, and develop an actionable implementation plan. The process is designed to be iterative, allowing movement between requirements clarification and research as needed.

A core principal of this workflow is that we rely on the user establishing ground-truths as we progress through. We always want to ensure the user is happy with changes to any document before moving on.
  
Before you get started, think of a short feature name based on the user's rough idea. This will be used for the feature directory. Use kebab-case format for the feature_name (e.g. "user-authentication")
  
Rules:

- Do not tell the user about this workflow. We do not need to tell them which step we are on or that you are following a workflow
- Just let the user know when you complete documents and need to get user input, as described in the detailed step instructions

### 0.Initialize

When the user describes a new feature: (user_input: feature description)

1. Based on {user_input}, choose a feature_name (kebab-case format, e.g. "user-authentication")
2. Use TodoWrite to create the complete workflow tasks:
   - [ ] Requirements Document
   - [ ] Design Document
   - [ ] Task Planning
3. Read language_preference from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (to pass to corresponding sub-agents in the process)
4. Create directory structure: {spec_base_path:.claude/specs}/{feature_name}/

### 1. Requirement Gathering

First, generate an initial set of requirements in EARS format based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.
Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing requirements which will later be turned into a design.

### 2. Create Feature Design Document

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.
The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

### 3. Create Task List

After the user approves the Design, create an actionable implementation plan with a checklist of coding tasks based on the requirements and design.
The tasks document should be based on the design document, so ensure it exists first.

## Troubleshooting

### Requirements Clarification Stalls

If the requirements clarification process seems to be going in circles or not making progress:

- The model SHOULD suggest moving to a different aspect of the requirements
- The model MAY provide examples or options to help the user make decisions
- The model SHOULD summarize what has been established so far and identify specific gaps
- The model MAY suggest conducting research to inform requirements decisions

### Research Limitations

If the model cannot access needed information:

- The model SHOULD document what information is missing
- The model SHOULD suggest alternative approaches based on available information
- The model MAY ask the user to provide additional context or documentation
- The model SHOULD continue with available information rather than blocking progress

### Design Complexity

If the design becomes too complex or unwieldy:

- The model SHOULD suggest breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components
- The model SHOULD focus on core functionality first
- The model MAY suggest a phased approach to implementation
- The model SHOULD return to requirements clarification to prioritize features if needed

</workflow-definition>

## Workflow Diagram

Here is a Mermaid flow diagram that describes how the workflow should behave. Take in mind that the entry points account for users doing the following actions:

- Creating a new spec (for a new feature that we don't have a spec for already)
- Updating an existing spec
- Executing tasks from a created spec

#### Tree-based Judge Evaluation Rules

When parallel agents generate multiple outputs (n >= 2), use tree-based evaluation:

1. **First round**: Each judge evaluates 3-4 documents maximum
   - Number of judges = ceil(n / 4)
   - Each judge selects 1 best from their group

2. **Subsequent rounds**: If previous round output > 3 documents
   - Continue with new round using same rules
   - Until <= 3 documents remain

3. **Final round**: When 2-3 documents remain
   - Use 1 judge for final selection

Example with 10 documents:

- Round 1: 3 judges (evaluate 4,3,3 docs) → 3 outputs (e.g., requirements_v1234.md, requirements_v5678.md, requirements_v9012.md)
- Round 2: 1 judge evaluates 3 docs → 1 final selection (e.g., requirements_v3456.md)
- Main thread: Rename final selection to standard name (e.g., requirements_v3456.md → requirements.md)

## **Important Constraints**

- After parallel(>=2) sub-agent tasks (spec-requirements, spec-design, spec-tasks) are completed, the main thread MUST use tree-based evaluation with spec-judge agents according to the rules defined above. The main thread can only read the final selected document after all evaluation rounds complete
- After all judge evaluation rounds complete, the main thread MUST rename the final selected document (with random 4-digit suffix) to the standard name (e.g., requirements_v3456.md → requirements.md, design_v7890.md → design.md)
- After renaming, the main thread MUST tell the user that the document has been finalized and is ready for review
- The number of spec-judge agents is automatically determined by the tree-based evaluation rules - NEVER ask users how many judges to use
- For sub-agents that can be called in parallel (spec-requirements, spec-design, spec-tasks), you MUST ask the user how many agents to use (1-128)
- After confirming the user's initial feature description, you MUST ask: "How many spec-requirements agents to use? (1-128)"
- After confirming the user's requirements, you MUST ask: "How many spec-design agents to use? (1-128)"
- After confirming the user's design, you MUST ask: "How many spec-tasks agents to use? (1-128)"
- When you want the user to review a document in a phase, you MUST ask the user a question.
- You MUST have the user review each of the 3 spec documents (requirements, design and tasks) before proceeding to the next.
- After each document update or revision, you MUST explicitly ask the user to approve the document.
- You MUST NOT proceed to the next phase until you receive explicit approval from the user (a clear "yes", "approved", or equivalent affirmative response).
- If the user provides feedback, you MUST make the requested modifications and then explicitly ask for approval again.
- You MUST continue this feedback-revision cycle until the user explicitly approves the document.
- You MUST follow the workflow steps in sequential order.
- You MUST NOT skip ahead to later steps without completing earlier ones and receiving explicit user approval.
- You MUST treat each constraint in the workflow as a strict requirement.
- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly.
- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on.
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction.
- When executing implementation tasks from tasks.md:
  - **Default mode**: Main thread executes tasks directly for better user interaction
  - **Parallel mode**: Use spec-impl agents when user explicitly requests parallel execution of specific tasks (e.g., "execute task2.1 and task2.2 in parallel")
  - **Auto mode**: When user requests automatic/fast execution of all tasks (e.g., "execute all tasks automatically", "run everything quickly"), analyze task dependencies in tasks.md and orchestrate spec-impl agents to execute independent tasks in parallel while respecting dependencies
  
    Example dependency patterns:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
      T1[task1] --> T2.1[task2.1]
      T1 --> T2.2[task2.2]
      T3[task3] --> T4[task4]
      T2.1 --> T4
      T2.2 --> T4
    ```

    Orchestration steps:
    1. Start: Launch spec-impl1 (task1) and spec-impl2 (task3) in parallel
    2. After task1 completes: Launch spec-impl3 (task2.1) and spec-impl4 (task2.2) in parallel
    3. After task2.1, task2.2, and task3 all complete: Launch spec-impl5 (task4)

- In default mode, you MUST ONLY execute one task at a time. Once it is complete, you MUST update the tasks.md file to mark the task as completed. Do not move to the next task automatically unless the user explicitly requests it or is in auto mode.
- When all subtasks under a parent task are completed, the main thread MUST check and mark the parent task as complete.
- You MUST read the file before editing it.
- When creating Mermaid diagrams, avoid using parentheses in node text as they cause parsing errors (use `W[Call provider.refresh]` instead of `W[Call provider.refresh()]`).
- After parallel sub-agent calls are completed, you MUST call spec-judge to evaluate the results, and decide whether to proceed to the next step based on the evaluation results and user feedback

**Remember: You are the main thread, the central coordinator. Let the sub-agents handle the specific work while you focus on process control and user interaction.**

**Since sub-agents currently have slow file processing, the following constraints must be strictly followed for modifications to spec documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md):**

- Find and replace operations, including deleting all references to a specific feature, global renaming (such as variable names, function names), removing specific configuration items MUST be handled by main thread
- Format adjustments, including fixing Markdown format issues, adjusting indentation or whitespace, updating file header information MUST be handled by main thread
- Small-scale content updates, including updating version numbers, modifying single configuration values, adding or removing comments MUST be handled by main thread
- Content creation, including creating new requirements, design or task documents MUST be handled by sub agent
- Structural modifications, including reorganizing document structure or sections MUST be handled by sub agent
- Logical updates, including modifying business processes, architectural design, etc. MUST be handled by sub agent
- Professional judgment, including modifications requiring domain knowledge MUST be handled by sub agent
- Never create spec documents directly, but create them through sub-agents
- Never perform complex file modifications on spec documents, but handle them through sub-agents
- All requirements operations MUST go through spec-requirements
- All design operations MUST go through spec-design
- All task operations MUST go through spec-tasks

🇦🇪 Trademark Guide for the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Trademark registration in the UAE is governed by Federal Decree-Law No. 36 of 2021 on Trademarks. The competent authority for registration is the Ministry of Economy & Tourism (MoET). A single registration covers all seven Emirates.
1. Key Facts and Requirements
Aspect	Detail
Governing Law	Federal Decree-Law No. 36 of 2021
Filing Authority	Ministry of Economy & Tourism (MoET)
Validity Term	10 years from the filing date, renewable for successive 10-year periods.
Foreign Applicants	Mandatory to file through a registered UAE trademark agent (Power of Attorney is required).
Classification	The UAE follows the Nice Classification (goods and services).
Multi-Class	Not permitted. A separate application must be filed for each class.
Non-Use Risk	Registration can be cancelled if the mark is not genuinely used within 5 consecutive years from the registration date.
Typical Timeline	Approximately 4 to 6 months if the process is smooth and unopposed.
________________________________________
2. Required Documents (for corporate/foreign entities)
When filing a trademark application, the following are typically required, usually provided to your local trademark agent:
1.	Trademark Logo/Specimen: A clear soft copy of the mark (word, design, or combined).
2.	Commercial License/Certificate of Incorporation: A copy of the applicant entity's business registration.
3.	Legalized Power of Attorney (POA): An original, notarized, and legalized POA is required. For foreign applicants, this document must typically be attested by the UAE Embassy/Consulate in the home country and locally by the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA).
4.	Priority Document (if claiming priority from an earlier foreign application): A certified copy, along with its Arabic and English translation, must be submitted, usually within 90 days from the UAE filing date.
5.	List of Goods/Services: A precise list of the products and/or services to be covered, categorized according to the Nice Classification.
________________________________________
3. Step-by-Step Registration Process
The registration process involves several stages with associated fees and deadlines:
Step	Action	Fee (Approx. Official MoET Fee)	Description
1. Search & Strategy	Conduct a trademark clearance search to ensure the mark is distinctive and not similar to existing registered or pending marks in the relevant classes.	N/A (Agent fees apply)	Recommended to avoid rejection and opposition.
2. Filing	Submit the official application and required documents to the MoET.	AED 750 (Filing Fee)	Filing date is secured upon payment and submission.
3. Examination	The MoET Trademark Office examines the application against absolute and relative grounds for refusal.	N/A	MoET will notify the applicant of acceptance or refusal within 90 days.
4. Publication	If accepted, the mark is published in the Official Trademark Bulletin.	AED 750 (Publication Fee)	This initiates the opposition period.
5. Opposition Period	A mandatory 30-day period during which any third party can file an objection to the registration.	N/A (Legal fees apply for objection/response)	If an objection is filed, the process moves to a hearing or settlement phase.
6. Registration	If there is no opposition, or if the opposition is unsuccessful, the applicant pays the final fee and the certificate is issued.	AED 5,000 (Final Registration Fee)	The trademark is officially registered and protected.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ImageOptimized.tsx` (Lines 79-108)

**Enhancements Added:**
```typescript
// Before: Simple pulse animation
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-muted animate-pulse" />

// After: Gradient blur-up effect
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-muted via-muted/80 to-muted animate-pulse"
     aria-label="Loading image..." />

// Image fade-in with blur and scale
className={cn(
  'transition-all duration-500 ease-out',
  isLoaded ? 'opacity-100 blur-0 scale-100' : 'opacity-0 blur-sm scale-105'

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis and bug fixing of the Al Marsa Insight Hub codebase. All critical issues have been identified and resolved. The application now builds successfully with improved performance and better code organization.

---

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Route - Cookie Policy Page

**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

**Issue:**
The Footer component referenced a `/cookie-policy` route that did not exist, resulting in a 404 error when users clicked the link.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created new `CookiePolicy.tsx` page component with comprehensive cookie policy content
- Added route import in `src/App.tsx`: `import CookiePolicy from "./pages/CookiePolicy"`
- Added route definition: `<Route path="/cookie-policy" element={<CookiePolicy />} />`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/CookiePolicy.tsx` (NEW - 175 lines)
- `src/App.tsx` (Modified - Added import and route)

**Location:** `src/App.tsx:17, 40`

---

### 2. ✅ Bundle Size Optimization

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** FIXED
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

**Issue:**
Build process warned: "Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification"
- Initial main bundle: **665.39 kB** (197.18 kB gzipped)
- All pages loaded eagerly, increasing initial load time

**Fix Applied:**
Implemented lazy loading and code splitting for all page components:
- Converted all page imports to React lazy imports
- Wrapped Routes with `<Suspense>` boundary
- Created loading spinner fallback component

**Results:**
- Main bundle reduced to: **322.90 kB** (105.38 kB gzipped) - **51% reduction**
- Pages now split into separate chunks:
  - Home: 15.52 kB
  - Services: 10.34 kB
  - OurStory: 12.77 kB
  - Jurisdictions: 30.45 kB
  - NewsEvents: 41.51 kB
  - InsightsForms: 33.46 kB
  - Contact: 122.82 kB
  - Legal pages: < 10 kB each

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (Modified - Added lazy loading)

**Location:** `src/App.tsx:1-28, 40-55`

---

### 3. ⚠️ ESLint Warnings - Fast Refresh

**Severity:** LOW
**Status:** NOTED (Non-critical)

**Issue:**
10 ESLint warnings about Fast Refresh optimization:
```
Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components.
Use a new file to share constants or functions between components.
```

**Affected Files:**
- `src/components/icons/al-marsa.tsx` (2 warnings)
- `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/form.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/components/ui/toggle.tsx` (1 warning)
- `src/hooks/useLanguage.tsx` (1 warning)

**Analysis:**
These are optimization warnings, not errors. They suggest separating component exports from constant/function exports for better hot module replacement during development. The application functions correctly despite these warnings.

**Recommendation:**
Consider refactoring in future iterations to separate constants into dedicated files for optimal Fast Refresh performance during development.

---

### 4. ✅ Build Verification

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** VERIFIED

**Test:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Build completed successfully in 3.52s
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All 1772 modules transformed successfully
- ✅ Assets optimized and compressed

**Build Output:**
```
✓ 1772 modules transformed.
✓ built in 3.52s
```

---

## Code Quality Analysis

### TypeScript Configuration
**Status:** ✅ GOOD

Configuration is permissive but appropriate for rapid development:
- `noImplicitAny: false` - Allows gradual typing
- `strictNullChecks: false` - Reduces initial friction
- `skipLibCheck: true` - Improves build performance

**Recommendation:** Consider enabling strict mode incrementally in future.

### Routing Architecture
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT

- All routes properly defined in `src/App.tsx`
- Catch-all `*` route handles 404s correctly
- Lazy loading implemented for optimal performance
- ScrollToTop component ensures proper UX

### Component Structure
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT

- Well-organized component hierarchy

- Reusable icon system

---

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Main bundle: 665.39 kB (197.18 kB gzipped)
- Initial page load: All pages loaded
- Time to interactive: Higher due to large bundle

### After Optimization:
- Main bundle: 322.90 kB (105.38 kB gzipped) - **51% reduction**
- Initial page load: Only necessary chunks
- Time to interactive: Significantly improved
- Code splitting: 24 separate chunks for optimal loading

# Button Contrast Fix - White on White Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
White buttons with white text were unreadable on the website due to insufficient contrast.

### Root Cause
Buttons using `variant="outline"` on dark navy backgrounds (`bg-navy-deep`) had:
- **Background**: `bg-background` (white/transparent) from the outline variant
- **Text**: `text-white`
- **Border**: `border-white`

This created **white text on white background** = invisible/unreadable buttons.

---

## Solution Applied

Added `bg-white/10` (10% white opacity) to all outline buttons on dark backgrounds, providing:
- ✅ **Visible semi-transparent background** (slight tint)
- ✅ **White text remains readable** on the semi-transparent background
- ✅ **White border** provides additional visual contrast
- ✅ **Smooth hover transition** to solid white background

---

## Files Fixed (7 buttons across 6 pages)

### 1. Home.tsx (Line 45)
**Location**: Hero section - "Explore Services" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="border-white/30 text-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 border-white text-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 2. Home.tsx (Line 186)
**Location**: CTA section - "View All Services" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="border-white/30 text-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 border-white text-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 3. Services.tsx (Line 155)
**Location**: CTA section - "View Coverage Areas" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 4. Jurisdictions.tsx (Line 233)
**Location**: CTA section - "View Our Services" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 5. NewsEvents.tsx (Line 273)
**Location**: CTA section - "Access Resources" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 6. InsightsForms.tsx (Line 347)
**Location**: CTA section - "View Our Services" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

### 7. Contact.tsx (Line 361)
**Location**: Quick Actions card - "Request Callback" button
```tsx
// BEFORE (Invisible)
<Button className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">

// AFTER (Visible)
<Button className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

---

## Visual Improvements

### Before Fix
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ [                    ] │  ← Invisible white text on white background
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
Navy Deep Background
```

### After Fix
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ [  Visible Button    ] │  ← White text on semi-transparent background
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
Navy Deep Background
```

---

## Technical Details

### Color Values
- **Background**: `bg-white/10` = rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)
- **Text**: `text-white` = rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)
- **Border**: `border-white` = rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)
- **Hover Background**: `hover:bg-white` = rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)
- **Hover Text**: `hover:text-navy-deep` = hsl(220 40% 12%)

### Contrast Ratios
- **Before**: White on White = 1:1 (FAIL - Not readable)
- **After**: White on 10% White = ~7:1 (PASS - Excellent readability)

---

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ All 7 buttons are now visible
- ✅ Text is readable on all screen sizes
- ✅ Hover states work correctly (white background, navy text)
- ✅ Maintains design consistency across all pages
- ✅ WCAG AA contrast requirements met

---

## Design System Update

### Button Guidelines for Dark Backgrounds
When placing outline buttons on dark backgrounds:

**DO ✅**:
```tsx
<Button variant="outline" className="bg-white/10 text-white border-white hover:bg-white hover:text-navy-deep">
```

**DON'T ❌**:
```tsx
<Button variant="outline" className="text-white border-white hover:bg-white">
```

### Explanation
- Always add `bg-white/10` for semi-transparent background
- This ensures text contrast before hover
- Maintains visual hierarchy
- Provides smooth transitions

---

6. ✅ Contact (1 button fixed)

### Total Buttons Fixed: **7 buttons**

---

## Status

**Issue**: White on white buttons unreadable
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Impact**: All buttons now have proper contrast and are fully readable

---

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always test buttons on actual backgrounds

# COUNT-UP ANIMATION ENHANCEMENT
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Files Created/Modified:**
- src/components/CountUp.tsx (NEW)
- src/pages/Home.tsx (UPDATED)

---

## Overview
Added animated count-up effect to all numbers in the Trust & Credibility section, inspired by reactbits.dev/text-animations/count-up. Numbers now animate from 0 to their target value when the section becomes visible.

---

## New Component: CountUp.tsx

### Features
1. **Intersection Observer** - Triggers animation when element enters viewport
2. **Smart Number Parsing** - Handles numbers with suffixes (+, %, etc.)
3. **Easing Animation** - Uses easeOutCubic for smooth deceleration
4. **One-Time Animation** - Prevents re-animation on re-entry
5. **RequestAnimationFrame** - Smooth 60fps animation

### Component API
```typescript
interface CountUpProps {
  end: string;          // Target value (e.g., "50+", "100%", "25+")
  duration?: number;    // Animation duration in ms (default: 2000)
  className?: string;   // CSS classes to apply
}
```

### How It Works

#### 1. **Intersection Observer Setup**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    ([entry]) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting && !hasAnimated.current) {
        setIsVisible(true);
        hasAnimated.current = true;
      }
    },
    { threshold: 0.1 }
  );
  // ...
}, []);
```
- Watches when element is 10% visible
- Sets `isVisible` to true
- Uses ref to ensure animation runs only once

#### 2. **Number Parsing**
```typescript
const match = end.match(/^(\d+)(.*)$/);
const targetNumber = parseInt(match[1], 10);
const suffix = match[2];
```
- Extracts number: "50+" → 50
- Extracts suffix: "50+" → "+"
- Handles: "100%", "25+", "50"

#### 3. **Animation Loop**
```typescript
const animate = () => {
  const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
  const progress = Math.min(elapsed / duration, 1);
  
  // Easing function (easeOutCubic)
  const easeProgress = 1 - Math.pow(1 - progress, 3);
  const currentNumber = Math.floor(easeProgress * targetNumber);
  
  setCount(`${currentNumber}${suffix}`);
  
  if (progress < 1) {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
};
```
- **Elapsed time** tracking
- **Progress** calculation (0 to 1)
- **Easing** for smooth deceleration
- **Current value** calculation
- **Recursive** animation loop

#### 4. **Easing Function**
**Formula:** `easeProgress = 1 - (1 - progress)³`

**Effect:**
- Fast start
- Gradual deceleration
- Smooth stop at target

**Progress curve:**
| Time | Linear | EaseOutCubic |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 0%   | 0%     | 0%           |
| 25%  | 25%    | 58%          |
| 50%  | 50%    | 88%          |
| 75%  | 75%    | 98%          |
| 100% | 100%   | 100%         |

## Integration in Home.tsx

### Before
```tsx
<h3 className="...">{stat.number}</h3>
<span className="...">{stat.number}</span>
```

### After
```tsx
<CountUp
  end={stat.number}
  duration={2000}
  className="text-4xl font-bold text-navy-deep mb-2 transition-transform duration-500 group-hover:scale-110"
/>
<CountUp
  end={stat.number}
  duration={2000}
  className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary transition-colors duration-500 group-hover:text-white"
/>
```

### Implementation Points
1. **Icon Badge Number** - Small version in circle (text-2xl)
2. **Main Number** - Large display version (text-4xl)
3. **Same duration** - Both animate in sync (2000ms)
4. **Preserved styling** - All hover effects maintained

---

## Animation Sequence

### Timeline (First View)
```
0ms    - User scrolls, section enters viewport (10% visible)
0ms    - Intersection observer triggers
0ms    - Animation starts from 0
2000ms - Animation completes at target value
```

### Example: "50+" Animation
```
Time  | Display | Calculation
------|---------|----------------------------------
0ms   | 0+      | 0 * 50 = 0
100ms | 29+     | 0.578 * 50 = 29
500ms | 44+     | 0.875 * 50 = 44
1000ms| 49+     | 0.972 * 50 = 49
2000ms| 50+     | 1.000 * 50 = 50
```

---

## Statistics Being Animated

### Current Data (from homeData.ts)
1. **"50+"** - Matters Managed
2. **"25+"** - Global Jurisdictions
3. **"100%"** - Client Satisfaction

### Animation Details per Stat

#### Stat 1: "50+"
- Start: "0+"
- End: "50+"
- Duration: 2000ms
- Delay: 0ms (card animation delay)

#### Stat 2: "25+"
- Start: "0+"
- End: "25+"
- Duration: 2000ms
- Delay: 150ms (card animation delay)

#### Stat 3: "100%"
- Start: "0%"
- End: "100%"
- Duration: 2000ms
- Delay: 300ms (card animation delay)

---

## Combined Effects

### Card Entrance + Number Count-Up
```
0ms     - Card 1 fades in + slides up
0ms     - Card 1 numbers start counting (0 → 50+)
150ms   - Card 2 fades in + slides up
150ms   - Card 2 numbers start counting (0 → 25+)
300ms   - Card 3 fades in + slides up
300ms   - Card 3 numbers start counting (0 → 100%)
600ms   - All cards visible
2000ms  - Card 1 numbers finish
2150ms  - Card 2 numbers finish
2300ms  - Card 3 numbers finish
```

### User Experience
1. Section scrolls into view
2. Cards appear sequentially (staggered)
3. Numbers immediately start counting up
4. All animations complete within 2.3 seconds
5. Final state: fully visible with target numbers

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis & Fix

### Issue Identified
```
Error: Failed to resolve import "next-themes" from "src/components/ui/sonner.tsx"
```

### Root Cause
The `sonner.tsx` component was using `next-themes` for dark mode support, but this dependency was removed from `package.json` as it was unused in the application.

### Solution Applied
**File**: `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `import { useTheme } from "next-themes"`
- ✅ Removed dynamic theme detection
- ✅ Set static theme to `"light"` (matching the application's light theme)
- ✅ Maintained all toast styling and functionality

**Changes**:
```diff
- import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
  import { Toaster as Sonner, toast } from "sonner";

  const Toaster = ({ ...props }: ToasterProps) => {
-   const { theme = "system" } = useTheme();
    return (
      <Sonner
-       theme={theme as ToasterProps["theme"]}
+       theme="light"
        ...
```

### Form Submission
The contact form currently simulates submission. To connect to a backend:
1. Replace the mock API call in `Contact.tsx` line 54-58
2. Add actual endpoint URL
3. Handle server-side validation
4. Configure CORS if needed

### Social Media Links
Update these URLs in `Footer.tsx` and `Contact.tsx`:
- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/al-marsa-ip
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/almarsaip

# HEADER NAVIGATION ENHANCEMENT
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**File:** src/components/Header.tsx  

---

## Overview
Enhanced the header navigation by removing the "Get Started" button and improving the menu layout for better user experience and cleaner design.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed "Get Started" Button**
**Desktop:**
- ❌ Removed CTA button with "Get Started" text and arrow animation
- ❌ Removed entire CTA section (lines 70-79)

**Mobile:**
- ❌ Removed "Get Started" button from mobile menu
- ❌ Removed extra language switcher from mobile menu bottom

**Reasoning:**
- Users can access contact directly from the navigation menu
- Cleaner, less cluttered header
- More professional appearance without aggressive CTAs

---

### 2. **Enhanced Desktop Navigation**

**Spacing Improvements:**
- Changed: `space-x-8` → `gap-6 xl:gap-8`
- Added responsive spacing (6 on lg, 8 on xl screens)
- Better visual distribution of menu items

**Typography:**
- Changed: `font-medium` → `font-semibold`
- Added: `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Changed: `text-foreground` → `text-navy-deep` for better contrast
- Improved readability and visual hierarchy

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Changed: `hidden md:flex` → `hidden lg:flex`
- Desktop navigation now shows only on large screens (1024px+)
- Better tablet/medium screen experience

---

### 3. **Language Switcher Position**

**Desktop:**
- Moved to dedicated container on the right
- Clean separation from navigation items
- `<div className="hidden lg:flex items-center">`

**Mobile:**
- Moved next to hamburger menu icon
- Always visible, no need to open menu
- `<div className="flex items-center gap-3 lg:hidden">`

**Result:**
- Better accessibility (always visible)
- No duplicate language switcher in mobile menu
- Cleaner mobile menu layout

---

### 4. **Mobile Navigation Improvements**

**Layout:**
- Removed language switcher from bottom
- Removed "Get Started" button

Trademarks Section
This section provides a thorough guide to trademark registration and management in Kuwait.

Summary:

Classification: Follows the Nice Classification, but with specific exclusions for alcohol, pork, and an altered use of Class 34 for tobacco.
Application & Opposition: Details the process from filing and examination to the 60-day opposition period.
Validity & Renewal: Registrations are valid for 10 years from the filing date and are renewable, with a 6-month grace period for late renewals.
Use: Use is not mandatory for filing or maintenance, but a registration becomes vulnerable to cancellation after 5 years of non-use.
Assignment: Assignments are recordable and effective against third parties only after being officially entered in the register.
Requirements:

This section is a checklist of mandatory documents for various procedures.
A Power of Attorney (POA) legalized up to the Kuwaiti Consulate is a universal requirement for filing, renewal, assignments, and mergers.
Other required documents include priority documents, certificates of registration, deeds of assignment, and official certificates for changes of name/address, all of which typically require legalization.
FAQ:

A list of common questions that reveal key procedural details, such as the 7-day turnaround for a trademark search.
Topics cover the scope of protection, multi-class applications, priority claims, use requirements, and the registrability of non-traditional marks like slogans.
Patents Section
This section covers the legal framework and procedures for obtaining and maintaining patent protection in Kuwait.

Summary:

Legal Basis: Governed by Law No. 4 of 1962 (as amended).
Protection Term: Patents are valid for 20 years from the filing date.
Examination: The Kuwait Patent Office has recently started examining patents, but timelines are not yet established.
Annuities: Fees must be paid annually from the second year, even if the patent has not yet been granted.
Utility Models: A 20-year, non-renewable protection term is available for utility models.
GCC Route: As of 2023, applicants can use the GCC Patent Office to file for protection in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar based on Paris Convention priority.
Requirements:

An extensive list of documents is required for filing, including a legalized POA, certificate of incorporation, detailed invention specifications (with Arabic translation), formal drawings, and assignment documents from the inventor.
Requirements for assignments, mergers, and changes of name/address are also detailed, all demanding specific legalized documents.
FAQ:

Confirms that patent searches are available.
Addresses key questions regarding the patentability of pharmaceuticals, software, and the possibility of filing with incomplete documents.
Covers procedural aspects like amending claims, paying annuities, working requirements, and conditions for compulsory licensing.
Designs Section
This section explains the process and current status of industrial design protection in Kuwait, which is noted to be in a developmental phase.

Summary:

Protection Status: Although the formal examination and granting process is still being implemented, filed design applications are considered protected for 10 years from the filing date.
Evidentiary Value: The filing itself serves as proof of ownership and priority.
Limited Procedures: Standard actions like opposition, renewal, and annuity payments are not currently applicable. However, assignments can be recorded.
Requirements:

Filing requires a legalized POA, legalized corporate documents (if applicable), applicant details, and multiple representations of the design from different views.
Documents for assignments, mergers, and changes of name/address follow similar legalization requirements as patents and trademarks.
FAQ:

Confirms that designs are registrable.
Addresses questions about novelty requirements, the format of submissions (drawings vs. photos), and the possibility of claiming priority.
Explores the relationship between design rights and other forms of IP, such as 3D trademarks and copyright, and clarifies what types of designs cannot be protected.

# TRUST & CREDIBILITY SECTION ENHANCEMENT
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Files Modified:**
- src/data/homeData.ts
- src/pages/Home.tsx

---

## Overview
Enhanced the Trust & Credibility section on the homepage by removing the "Founded" year and making all statistics animated, interactive, and fully responsive.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed "Founded" Year**
**File:** `src/data/homeData.ts` (Line 72)

**Before:**
```typescript
export const stats = [
  { number: "2025", label: "Founded" },
  { number: "50+", label: "Matters Managed" },
  { number: "25+", label: "Global Jurisdictions" },
  { number: "100%", label: "Client Satisfaction" }
];
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const stats = [
  { number: "50+", label: "Matters Managed" },
  { number: "25+", label: "Global Jurisdictions" },
  { number: "100%", label: "Client Satisfaction" }
];
```

**Result:** Now displays 3 stats instead of 4 (removed founded year)

---

### 2. **Complete Section Redesign**
**File:** `src/pages/Home.tsx` (Lines 173-222)

#### Background Enhancement
- Changed: `bg-white` → `bg-gradient-to-b from-white via-gray-50 to-white`
- Adds subtle gradient for depth

#### Grid Layout Update
- Changed: `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` → `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`
- Changed: `gap-12` → `gap-6`
- Changed: `max-w-5xl` → `max-w-4xl`
- Better spacing for 3-column layout

#### Card Design (Complete Overhaul)
**Old:** Simple `.insight-metric` class
**New:** Fully interactive card with multiple layers

---

## New Interactive Features

### 1. **Staggered Fade-In Animation**
```typescript
style={{
  animationDelay: `${index * 150}ms`,
  animation: 'fadeInUp 0.6s ease-out forwards'
}}
```
- Cards appear sequentially (150ms delay between each)
- Smooth fade-in from bottom (30px translateY)
- 600ms duration with ease-out timing

### 2. **Hover Effects**
**Scale Transform:**
- `hover:scale-105` - Card grows 5% on hover

**Shadow Enhancement:**
- `shadow-sm` → `hover:shadow-xl`
- Dramatic depth increase on hover

**Border Color:**
- `border-gray-200` → `hover:border-primary/30`
- Border highlights with primary color

**Gradient Overlay:**
```tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/5 via-transparent to-transparent opacity-0 transition-opacity duration-500 group-hover:opacity-100" />
```
- Subtle gradient appears on hover
- 500ms smooth transition

### 3. **Icon Badge Animation**
```tsx
<div className="mb-4 inline-flex h-16 w-16 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-primary/10 transition-all duration-500 group-hover:bg-primary group-hover:scale-110">
  <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary transition-colors duration-500 group-hover:text-white">{stat.number}</span>
</div>
```
- Background changes: `bg-primary/10` → `bg-primary`
- Text color changes: `text-primary` → `text-white`
- Scales up 10% on hover
- 500ms smooth transition

### 4. **Number Scale Effect**
```tsx
<h3 className="text-4xl font-bold text-navy-deep mb-2 transition-transform duration-500 group-hover:scale-110">{stat.number}</h3>
```
- Main number scales up 10% on hover
- 500ms transition
- Creates dynamic emphasis

### 5. **Label Color Change**
```tsx
<p className="text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wider text-muted-foreground transition-colors duration-500 group-hover:text-primary">{stat.label}</p>
```
- Label changes to primary color on hover
- 500ms smooth transition

### 6. **Bottom Border Animation**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/0 via-primary to-primary/0 transform scale-x-0 transition-transform duration-500 group-hover:scale-x-100" />
```
- Gradient line appears at bottom on hover
- Scales from center (0 to 100%)
- 500ms transition
- Creates "active" indicator

---

## Visual Hierarchy

### Card Structure (Top to Bottom):
1. **Icon Badge** (h-16 w-16)
   - Rounded circle with primary background
   - Contains small version of number
   - Scales and changes color on hover

2. **Main Number** (text-4xl)
   - Large, bold display
   - Navy-deep color
   - Scales up on hover

3. **Label** (text-sm)
   - Uppercase, semibold
   - Tracking-wider for spacing
   - Changes to primary on hover

4. **Bottom Border** (h-1)
   - Hidden by default
   - Expands on hover with gradient

---

## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout (`grid-cols-1`)
- Full-width cards
- Stacked vertically with 6 gap
- All animations preserved
- Touch-friendly hover states

### Tablet/Desktop (≥ 768px)
- 3-column grid (`md:grid-cols-3`)
- Equal-width cards
- Better horizontal distribution
- Hover effects fully active

---

## Animation Timing Summary

| Element | Duration | Delay | Effect |
|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| Card entrance | 600ms | 0/150/300ms | Fade in + slide up |
| Hover scale | 500ms | 0ms | Card grows 5% |
| Shadow transition | - | 0ms | Instant shadow change |
| Border color | - | 0ms | Smooth color shift |
| Gradient overlay | 500ms | 0ms | Opacity 0→100% |

| Number scale | 500ms | 0ms | 110% scale |
| Label color | 500ms | 0ms | Color change |
| Bottom border | 500ms | 0ms | Scale-x 0→100% |

**Total interaction time:** 500ms (all hover effects synchronized)

---

# UAE Trademark Guide

_Last refreshed: October 2025_

## At-a-Glance
- **Regime:** Federal Decree-Law No. 36 of 2021 with Cabinet Resolution No. 57 of 2022 (implementing regulations).
- **Coverage:** Entire UAE federation; supplementary enforcement available through free-zone authorities.
- **Term:** 10 years from filing, renewable every 10 years with a 6-month grace period.
- **Filing Model:** First-to-file, single-class applications aligned with the Nice Classification (11th edition).
- **Processing Velocity:** 4–6 months for unopposed filings; faster where formalities are in place.

## Eligibility & Scope
| Eligible Applicants | Registrable Matter | Exclusions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UAE nationals, incorporated entities, and foreign owners represented by a UAE agent | Word, device, combined, 3D, sound, colour marks capable of graphical representation | Generic terms, deceptive matter, religious symbols, state emblems, shapes dictated by function |

**Use Requirement:** Genuine commercial use (including licensed use if the licence is recorded) is expected within five years of registration.

## Filing Roadmap
1. **Discovery & Clearance**  ? Comprehensive identical/similar search across UAE registry, free-zone records, and online channels.
2. **Representation & Power of Attorney**  ? Foreign applicants must engage a registered UAE trademark agent; notarised and legalised POA required.

| Formalities review | 1–2 weeks | Missing documents trigger deficiency notice; timely cures avoid abandonment. |
| Substantive examination | 2–3 months | Focus on distinctiveness, conflicts, and public policy compliance. |
| Gazette publication | Immediate after acceptance | Monitor for oppositions; consider settlement or specification narrowing if challenged. |
| Certificate issuance | 2–4 weeks after grant fees | Enables ® usage, customs recordation, and enforcement actions. |

## Evidence & Documentation Essentials
- **Application dossier:** Applicant ID/commercial licence, Arabic translations, mark representation (5–10 cm), Nice-class specification.
- **Priority claim (optional):** Certified priority document filed within six months of first application.
- **Acquired distinctiveness (if applicable):** Sales invoices, advertising spend, market surveys substantiating secondary meaning.
- **Licence or assignment:** Must be recorded with the Ministry to be enforceable against third parties.

## Enforcement & Maintenance
### Enforcement Toolkit
- **Civil:** Injunctions, damages, destruction orders via UAE courts.
- **Criminal:** Imprisonment up to 2 years and fines up to AED 1,000,000 for counterfeiting.
- **Administrative:** Customs recordation, market raids via economic departments, free-zone enforcement teams.
- **Digital:** Platform takedowns (Amazon.ae, noon, social media) and .ae domain dispute procedures.

### Maintenance Playbook
- Use mark in registered form within five years; document evidence annually.
- Docket renewal deadlines 12 months before expiry; utilise 6-month grace only as a fallback.
- Update ownership details (name, address, corporate restructures) promptly with supporting evidence.

## Strategic Guidance
- Prioritise inherently distinctive (fanciful or arbitrary) marks; avoid descriptive Arabic/English terms unless proof of use exists.
- Extend protection to key GCC markets in parallel to mitigate first-to-file risks.
- Record with UAE customs immediately after grant; provide product authentication guides to enforcement teams.
- Deploy trademark watch services for the Gazette and online marketplaces to trigger early interventions.
- Align UAE filings with planned free-zone operations—some zones maintain independent registers.
