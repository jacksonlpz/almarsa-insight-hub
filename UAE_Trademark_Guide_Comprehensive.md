## Filing Roadmap

7. **Grant Formalities**  ? Pay grant fees within 30 days post-opposition; certificate issued within 2–4 weeks.

## Timelines & Filings Snapshot
| Stage | Indicative Duration | Key Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Formalities review | 1–2 weeks | Missing documents trigger deficiency notice; timely cures avoid abandonment. |
| Substantive examination | 2–3 months | Focus on distinctiveness, conflicts, and public policy compliance. |
| Gazette publication | Immediate after acceptance | Monitor for oppositions; consider settlement or specification narrowing if challenged. |
| Certificate issuance | 2–4 weeks after grant fees | Enables ® usage, customs recordation, and enforcement actions. |

## Evidence & Documentation Essentials
- **Application dossier:** Applicant ID/commercial licence, Arabic translations, mark representation (5–10 cm), Nice-class specification.
- **Priority claim (optional):** Certified priority document filed within six months of first application.
- **Acquired distinctiveness (if applicable):** Sales invoices, advertising spend, market surveys substantiating secondary meaning.
- **Licence or assignment:** Must be recorded with the Ministry to be enforceable against third parties.

## Enforcement & Maintenance
### Enforcement Toolkit
- **Civil:** Injunctions, damages, destruction orders via UAE courts.
- **Criminal:** Imprisonment up to 2 years and fines up to AED 1,000,000 for counterfeiting.
- **Administrative:** Customs recordation, market raids via economic departments, free-zone enforcement teams.
- **Digital:** Platform takedowns (Amazon.ae, noon, social media) and .ae domain dispute procedures.

### Maintenance Playbook
- Use mark in registered form within five years; document evidence annually.
- Docket renewal deadlines 12 months before expiry; utilise 6-month grace only as a fallback.
- Update ownership details (name, address, corporate restructures) promptly with supporting evidence.

## Strategic Guidance
- Prioritise inherently distinctive (fanciful or arbitrary) marks; avoid descriptive Arabic/English terms unless proof of use exists.
- Extend protection to key GCC markets in parallel to mitigate first-to-file risks.
- Record with UAE customs immediately after grant; provide product authentication guides to enforcement teams.
- Deploy trademark watch services for the Gazette and online marketplaces to trigger early interventions.
- Align UAE filings with planned free-zone operations—some zones maintain independent registers.
